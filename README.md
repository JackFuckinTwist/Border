# Border
Border is a simple overlay for RTS games (such as Age of Empires 2) for displaying build orders on top of the game. It is mainly intended for new players or getting help playing new maps. This will help you to learn the strategies that are used online. You might find features that are tailored to Age of Empires 2, since it was the reason for my to build this.

If you have no idea what a Build Order is or don't know what the app means, check out [this](https://github.com/abductedPlatypus/border/wiki/build-orders) for a short read.

__Important:__ Not all build orders have been tested by multiple people, so I'd be happy if you comment on the default Build Orders added. You can comment [on this issue](https://github.com/abductedPlatypus/Border/issues/1).

## FAQ

### Can I use this online?
It's up to you. The current version of this overlay does not communicate with the game so I doubt they will detect it.  
I think it's okay, I used to have my tablet up with a couple of Build Orders. But I always lost track. But one could argue that it removes the skill of game knowledge. 

### Why did you make this tool?
I wanted to learn a new programming thing and I was really into learning Age of Empires 2.

### Can I add my own Build Orders?
Yes, it does require a bit (straightforward) of editing a textfile (e.g. Notepad) though. See [this page](https://github.com/abductedPlatypus/border/wiki/add-build-orders) for details.  

If you made great build orders you and would like to donate them to this app [open an issue](https://github.com/abductedPlatypus/Border/issues/new).

### How do I know if there is a new version?
The app will bug you about it.
